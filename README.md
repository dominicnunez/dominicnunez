# Hey, I'm Dominic

The greatest prompt engineer that ever lived.

I make things with AI and ship them from a terminal. Most of my best work is in private repos — you'll just have to trust me on that.

## What I'm Working On

🍩 [**Springfield**](https://github.com/dominicnunez/springfield) — Autonomous AI development kit

🧠 **AI companion** — memory system that actually remembers more than your name (private)

❄️ **Nix flakes** — packaging developer tools so they just work

🦞 **OpenClaw contributor** — [structured error classification](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/16521) refactor (PR ready, waiting on maintainers)

## Stack
