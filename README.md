# Hey, I'm Dominic 👋

Builder. The greatest not-engineer that ever lived.

I make things with AI and ship them from a terminal. Most of my best work is in private repos — you'll just have to trust me on that.

## What I'm Working On

🧠 **AI companion app** — memory system that actually remembers you (not just your name and that you like coffee)

❄️ **Nix flakes** — packaging developer tools so they Just Work™. [opencode-nix](https://github.com/dominicnunez/opencode-nix) and [claude-code-nix](https://github.com/dominicnunez/claude-code-nix) are the public ones

🦞 **OpenClaw contributor** — [structured error classification](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/16521) refactor (PR ready, waiting on maintainers)

⚡ **Thor** — Go-based crypto analytics (private)

## Stack

**Frontend:** SvelteKit · Tailwind · shadcn  
**Backend:** Convex · Go  
**Infra:** NixOS · Hetzner Helsinki 🇫🇮  
**AI:** Claude (obviously)
